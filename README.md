# Movie Favorites App

This is a simple Next.js application that allows users to manage their favorite movies. The application uses the `next/server` module for handling server-side requests and responses.

## Getting Started

1. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## API Endpoints

The application provides the following API endpoints:

- `GET /api/favorites`: Retrieves the list of favorite movie IDs.
- `POST /api/favorites`: Adds a movie to the favorites list. The request body should contain a JSON object with a `movieId` property.
- `DELETE /api/favorites`: Removes a movie from the favorites list. The request body should contain a JSON object with a `movieId` property.

## Notes

- In this example, the favorites are stored in memory and will be lost when the server restarts. For a real-world application, you would typically use a database to persist the favorites.
- The code provided is a basic example and does not include any error handling or input validation. You may need to add additional logic as needed.
